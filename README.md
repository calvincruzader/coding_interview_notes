# Hello!

---
Just making notes on my coding practice as I'm preparing for interviews. Nothing much else to see here, I just need to log stuff to remember key things I don't know.
---
So far,I have notes on linked lists/stacks/queues/trees/searching algos/ and graphs in Python. 
Going to do some practice problems in now in Java and Python, see how that works out.
